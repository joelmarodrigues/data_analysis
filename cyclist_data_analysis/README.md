# Cyclist Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze cyclist traffic data in Dublin, focusing on identifying patterns in cyclist activity throughout different times of the year. The objective is to explore the trends, identify peak cycling hours, and understand how weather or other factors influence cycling in the city.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **R**: dplyr, ggplot2

## Objectives
- Clean and explore the dataset to identify relevant trends.
- Analyze cyclist activity across various timeframes (e.g., weekdays vs. weekends, seasonal variations).
- Create visualizations to represent key findings.

## Current Status
- **Data Collection**: Dataset has been sourced from public Dublin cycling data.
- **Data Cleaning**: In progress.
- **Analysis and Visualization**: Pending.

## Future Improvements
- Implement machine learning models to predict cyclist activity based on historical trends.
- Publish the findings in a well-documented report.

## Folder Structure
- **/data**: Raw and processed data files.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning and analysis.
- **/visualizations**: Output graphs and visualizations.
