# SQL Queries for Data Insights Project

## Overview
This project focuses on using SQL to extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The dataset may involve topics such as retail sales, customer analytics, or general business metrics. The main goal is to demonstrate SQL skills, including data extraction, aggregation, and report generation.

## Tools Used
- **MySQL**: Database creation and query execution.
- **SQL**: Queries for data analysis, including joins, aggregations, and CTEs.

## Objectives
- Create a relational database using the available dataset.
- Perform complex queries to generate useful insights.
  - Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
  - Complex Joins
  - Use of CTEs and window functions for advanced data analysis.

## Current Status
- **Database Design**: Completed.
- **Data Import**: In progress.
- **SQL Queries**: Writing basic queries for data insights.

## Folder Structure
- **/sql_scripts**: SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and running queries.
- **/reports**: Output of queries in text or CSV format.
